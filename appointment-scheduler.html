	<h1>Appointment Scheduler Application</h1>
	<p>The appointment scheduler application is a full-stack JavaFX application that stores and uses data from a database. The business logic and database logic were programmed using Java. The frontend is xml and css.</p> 
	<p>I implemented a login system that queries a MySQL database in order to facilitate users securely logging in.</p>

	<p>This is the main screen of the application where the list of appointments can be seen. From this screen appointments can be filtered by date, week, month, and a consultant schedule can be generated as well. All data is stored in the database.</p>

	<p>Report data can be generated and displayed from the main screen. For example, how many of each kind of appointment there are.</p>

	<p>Customers and appointments can be added to the system via popup windows.</p>
