	<h1>Wizard, an Action Roleplaying Game</h1>
	<h2>Technologies used:</h2>
	<h3>Java, Libgdx framework</h3>
	<p>Wizard is a passion project of mine that I'm working on to further hone my programming skills. This project is an action roleplaying game featuring the slaying of a variety of monsters, a host of spells that evolve as the player wizard gains in power, classic roleplaying game leveling and statistics, dungeon exploration, and much more.</p>

	<p>Magic missile is a spell that increases in the number of projectiles as the wizard gains in experience.</p>

	<p>The wizard can find a variety of spellbooks to increase his spell repertoire or increase the power and utility of the spells he already knows.</p>
